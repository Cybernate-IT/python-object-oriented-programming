# Section 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism

## [Video 4](#) : Creating and Using Subclasses

### Introduction to Inheritance
Get acquainted with the concept of inheritance and how it facilitates the creation of subclasses based on existing classes.

### Defining a Subclass in Python
Explore the syntax and mechanics of defining a subclass in Python, laying the foundation for building upon existing classes.

### Inheriting Attributes from the Parent Class
Understand how attributes are inherited from the parent class to the subclass, promoting code reuse and organizational efficiency.

### Adding Additional Attributes to the Subclass
Discover how subclasses can introduce additional attributes, enhancing their uniqueness and expanding functionality.

### Overriding Methods in the Subclass
Learn the art of method overriding, where methods in the subclass can replace or augment those in the parent class.

### Accessing the Parent Class from the Subclass
Understand how to access and utilize attributes and methods from the parent class within the subclass.

### Use Cases for Subclasses and Inheritance
Explore practical use cases for subclasses and inheritance, demonstrating their relevance and effectiveness in various scenarios.

## [Video 5](#) : Method Overriding and Polymorphism

### Understanding Method Overriding
Delve into the concept of method overriding, where a method in a subclass provides a specific implementation that differs from the parent class.

### Overriding Methods in Subclasses
Explore the process of overriding methods in subclasses, tailoring them to meet the specific needs of the subclass.

### Accessing Overridden Methods from the Subclass
Understand how to access overridden methods from the subclass, ensuring seamless integration with the inheritance hierarchy.

### Polymorphism in Python
Grasp the concept of polymorphism, allowing objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type.

### Achieving Polymorphism through Method Overriding
See how method overriding contributes to achieving polymorphism in Python, enhancing flexibility in your code.

### Demonstrating Polymorphism with Examples
Solidify your understanding of polymorphism by exploring practical examples that showcase its application.

### Abstract Classes and Interfaces
Introduce abstract classes and interfaces as powerful tools for achieving abstraction and defining common behavior in Python.
