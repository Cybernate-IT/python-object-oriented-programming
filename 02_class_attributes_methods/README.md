# Section 2: Class Attributes and Methods

## [Video 2](#) : Defining Attributes and Methods within Classes

### Overview of Attributes and Methods
Gain insights into the significance of attributes and methods within classes and their role in shaping the behavior of objects.

### Declaration of Attributes in Classes
Understand the process of declaring attributes within classes, defining the characteristics of objects.

### Instance Attributes
Explore instance attributes, variables specific to individual instances of a class.

### Class Attributes
Learn about class attributes, properties shared among all instances of a class.

### Defining Methods in Classes
Dive into the definition of methods within classes, the functions that encapsulate behaviors.

- **Instance Methods**
Understand the concept of instance methods, functions that operate on instance-specific data.
- **Class Methods**
Explore class methods, functions associated with the class rather than instances.
- **Static Methods**
Discover static methods, functions that are independent of instances or class data.

### Access Modifiers (Public, Private, Protected)
Learn about access modifiers, controlling the visibility of attributes and methods within a class.

### Setter and Getter Methods
Explore the use of setter and getter methods to control access to attributes and ensure data integrity.

### Examples of Classes with Attributes and Methods
See practical examples of classes incorporating attributes and methods, providing hands-on experience with the concepts covered.

## [Video 3](#): Instance and Class Variables

### Introduction to Instance and Class Variables
Understand the distinctions between instance and class variables and their roles in the structure of classes.

### Instance Variables
- **Declaration and Usage**: Explore the declaration and usage of instance variables within classes.
- **Lifetime of Instance Variables**: Understand the lifecycle of instance variables and how they relate to object instances.

### Class Variables
- **Declaration and Usage**: Learn about class variables, shared among all instances of a class.
- **Shared Data among Instances**: Explore how class variables facilitate data sharing among instances.
- **Lifetime of Class Variables**: Understand the lifecycle of class variables within the context of the class.

### Differences between Instance and Class Variables
Compare and contrast instance and class variables to grasp their unique characteristics.

### Use Cases for Instance and Class Variables
Discover scenarios where instance and class variables play crucial roles in designing effective classes.

### Examples Demonstrating the Use of Instance and Class Variables
Solidify your understanding with practical examples showcasing the application of instance and class variables in Python classes.
