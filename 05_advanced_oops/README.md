## [Video 8](#) : Decorators, Properties, and Class Methods

### Understanding Decorators in Python
Get acquainted with decorators in Python, a powerful tool for modifying or extending the behavior of functions and methods.

### Decorating Methods in Classes
Learn how to apply decorators to methods within classes, extending their functionality.

#### `@property Decorator`
- **Creating Read-Only Properties**: Explore the use of @property to create read-only properties, enhancing data access.
- **Setter Methods for Properties**: Understand how to implement setter methods for properties, enabling controlled data modification.
- **Deleter Methods for Properties**: Discover the use of deleter methods for properties, facilitating property deletion.

#### `@classmethod Decorator`
- **Defining Class Methods**: Dive into the @classmethod decorator, allowing the creation of methods that operate on the class itself.
- **Use Cases for Class Methods**: Explore practical scenarios where class methods are beneficial.

#### `@staticmethod Decorator`
- **Creating Static Methods in Classes**: Understand the @staticmethod decorator for creating methods that are independent of instance or class data.
- **Differences between Class and Static Methods**: Differentiate between class and static methods, understanding their distinct roles.

### Practical Examples of Decorators, Properties, and Class Methods

## [Video 9](#) : Magic Methods and Operator Overloading

### Introduction to Magic Methods
Explore magic methods in Python, special methods with double underscores that provide functionality to classes.

### Common Magic Methods in Python
- `__init__`: Initializing Objects: Learn how the init method initializes objects during creation.
- `__str__` and `__repr__`: String Representations: Understand the significance of `__str__` and `__repr__` for providing string representations of objects.
- `__len__`: Length of Objects: Discover how the len method determines the length of objects.

### Operator Overloading
- `__add__`, `__sub__`, etc.: Operator Overloading: Learn how to overload arithmetic operators to customize object behavior.

### Overloading Comparison Operators
- `__eq__`, `__ne__`, `__lt__`, `__gt__`, etc.: Explore the overloading of comparison operators, allowing customized comparisons between objects.

### Customizing Attribute Access with getattr and setattr
Understand how to customize attribute access using the getattr and setattr magic methods.

### Use Cases for Magic Methods and Operator Overloading
Explore practical scenarios where magic methods and operator overloading enhance the functionality and usability of classes.

### Practical Examples Demonstrating Magic Methods
Solidify your understanding with real-world examples demonstrating the application of magic methods in Python classes.
